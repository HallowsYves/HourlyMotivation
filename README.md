# HourlyMotivation
The "HourlyMotivation"project is a dynamic and motivational Discord bot designed to deliver hourly doses of inspiration to its users! It combines the power of Amazon AWS S3 buckets, the PALM API, and the Flickr API to create and deliver motivational quotes and images on a regular basis.


# How does it work?
**PALM API Integration:** The project starts by utilizing the PALM API to generate a prompt. This prompt is to inspire and motivate users. PALM, which stands for "Pattern Learning and Matching," is an AI model capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives.

**Quote Generation:** Once the prompt is generated, HourlyMotivation passes this prompt back to itself, effectively acting as a creative loop. This self-referencing approach ensures that the generated text aligns with the motivational theme. The result is a motivational quote that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.

**Flickr API for Images:** To complement the text, HourlyMotivation relies on the Flickr API to fetch a random inspiring image. Flickr is a popular platform for sharing photos, and its API allows access to a vast collection of images. The selected image is designed to visually enhance the motivational message.

**Merging Text and Image:** The project then merges the generated motivational quote with the selected image. This creates a visually appealing and motivational graphic that resonates with the users.

**Discord Bot Integration:** Finally, the combined motivational content is sent to a Discord bot. This bot is responsible for distributing the motivational content to HourlyMotivation's users on the Discord platform. Users receive these inspirational messages on an hourly basis, providing a steady stream of motivation throughout the day.
